# SVK-Landing-Page

The objective here is to create a clean, elegant, functional, and responsive Personal Landing Page that showcases who I am, what I do, what I've done, and more. 

In addition it will have a link to my main Wordpress blog. 

In the process of making this page, I'm learning new things about design, coding, and more along the way. I've not had many opportunities to put what I've learned to practice so I'm doing that here. 
The result will likely be a page that has a lot of mistakes and problems from a coding perspective as I don't know all the "best practices."

Regardless, it will still be pretty exciting to make this site completely from scratch and using my own handwritten code. 

Hopefully this will be the first of many sites I end up coding from scratch.
